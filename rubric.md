# Process for Giving and Receiving Feedback

1. Part of Day 1 will be devoted to logistics of giving and receiving feedback.
2. Participants should begin practicing providing feedback for pre-defined segments while the :octocat: trainer is teaching. This feedback will be provided on paper using the [Feedback Rubric](#feedback-rubric-on-paper), or can be provided in open issues as well. 
3. During teachbacks, participants will be expected to perform self-reflections following each topic using the [Self Reflection Tool](#self-reflection-tool-electronic).
4. Participants provide feedback to each other during teachbacks using [Feedback Rubric](#feedback-rubric-on-paper). This feedback will be performed on paper and kept in each participant's binder, but can also be done via issues.
5. Participants will wrap up each round of teachbacks by using the [Self Reflection Tool](#self-reflection-tool-electronic). This reflection will be performed electronically and kept in the participant's private repo.


## Feedback Rubric (on paper)

Fill out this form for each presentation your teammate gives.

- Trainer:
- Topic:

- List one thing you :heart: about this presentation.

- List one thing that could be done differently next time.

## Self Reflection Tool (electronic)

When prompted by the :octocat: trainer, create an issue in your private class repo with the label 'reflection'. The issue will be pre-filled with the following template.

1. What trait do you see in things that your classmates :heart: about your presentations?

2. What trait do you see in things that your classmates suggested you do differently next time?
3. For each item below, indicate whether you agree or disagree with the statement. Use the following key:
  - :+1: = I agree with the statement
  - :-1: = I disagree with the statement
  - :question: = I am unsure of how to answer this statement and I need help from a :octocat: trainer
